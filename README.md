Giant Coin (GIC) is a digital currency which is planned to be used as a sole means of payment in various decentralized applications (DApps) based on the Giant blockchain.  When establishing the system, the project team [made sure](https://giantpay.network/pages/governance-mechanism-of-giant) to adhere to the ideals of decentralization. In practice, this means no more financial scandals based on the conflict of interests. The Giant Coin network is operated by masternode owners. All masternode owners have made an initial investment of 1000 GIC and thus they are interested in the increase of the system well-being. Various votes will be held to ensure the safe future of the project.

Giant Coin also has [its own implementation](https://giantpay.network/whitepaper/contracts) of the popular Smart Contracts technology based on Javascript. Giant smart contracts have been designed with bets in mind, meaning they will adequately respond to the needs of two planned DApps: [Giant.Exchange](https://giantpay.network/whitepaper/exchange), a transparent binary options marketplace, and Giant.Bet, a sports betting platform. To test the said smart contracts and their new variants, the Giant team is making a sandbox environment and development kit called Giantjs, see its [GitHub page](https://github.com/GiantPay/giantjs) to learn more about its code.

Giant Coin will soon move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, meaning that masternode owners and the number of stakes held by each participant will be compared and automatically regulated. This ‘see-saw’ principle comes from Zerocoin whitepaper and the cryptocurrency called PIVX. The move to PoS is backed by several crucial factors: there will be a reduction of block time and the subsequent increase of the speed of transactions, scalability (long-term growth) issues will be solved and, lastly, mining whales will not be able to harm the project economy anymore. Details [can be read](https://giantpay.network/pages/proof-of-stake-explained) in a dedicated educational material. An illustrative table which compares the main features of Giant blockchain to other popular products [is available](https://giantpay.network/pages/giant-blockchain-the-best-features-of-dash-and-ethereum) in a separate article.

The project [roadmap](https://giantpay.network/roadmap) and [White Paper](https://giantpay.network/whitepaper) are available on our website, more news on short-term and mid-term goals can be found [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/wFBmkJD) in the #announcements channel.
